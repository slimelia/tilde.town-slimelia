and the ultimate bloging begins...

i can't decide what to use this blog for!! i've been using my gemlog for more detailed personal life updates and i can't be bothered to repeat myself here. maybe i'll do something fun like just spotlight cool things i find online??

FOR EXAMPLEEEE i recently found the search engine Kagi. i really like it, the results it produces are very good, the people behind it and their ethos seem really good, and i love all the extra features it contains. they also have a few fun side projects like [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) which highlights random individual blogs and small websites across the world wide web. it's a super cute initiative!

anyway, i guess this is what i'm gonna use this web-facing blog for, at least for now! if you have a passing interest in the woman BEHIND the blog, check out the super secret [gemlog](/~slimelia/pages/gemlog.html) oooooh
