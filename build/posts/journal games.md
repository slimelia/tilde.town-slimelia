@title journal games @author slimelia @date 2025-02-17T11:58

i've been looking at singleplayer ttrpg games lately because it turns
out i own a fair few as a result of various itch.io bundles i've bought
throughout the years!

i've yet to play any, but i must admit the "solo journaling rpgs" have
piqued my interest. it's just not something i knew even existed and i
feel like it might be a fun creative writing exercise

i own the [alone on a journey
zine](https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-on-a-journey) which contains 3
games in it, and i printed the printable booklet version a good few
months back now and never touched it.

i keep toying with the idea of playing one of these journaling rpgs and
posting the journals here - either one post every day or just one post a
week. but i also.. don't know if i'm willing to be that vulnerable in a
public setting. i suppose i could write the journals to my gemlog, which
is still public but feels more private because of how it is accessed.

i dunno. do you think it'd be interesting? should i bite the bullet and
be publicly vulnerable or hide my shame in geminispace? have you heard
of solo journaling rpgs, or played one yourself? i'd love to hear what
you think! thoughts on a postcard to
