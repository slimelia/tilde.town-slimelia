so for some reason the image in my last post did not show up in my RSS
reader. they _did_ when i forced miniflux to fetch original content, but
i'd rather people not have to do that, especially in RSS readers without
that feature! weirdly the image is present when i use the Feed Preview
firefox extension so i guess maybe it is my RSS reader being weird??

i _think_ it may be a weird thing happening with inline styling on the
image tag. so: below is a shite selfie i took yesterday on me lunch
break. if it shows up in feeds: yay! if it doesn't: i can't be bothered
to diagnose the issue further right now. soz
