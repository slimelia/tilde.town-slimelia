@title Pulse Nightclub Shooting @author slimelia @date 2016-06-12

Very brief but very serious post.

RIP to all those who died during the Pulse Nightclub mass shooting, and power to those who were injured - I hope that you recover swiftly. This news is incredibly distressing and saddening, and my heart feels so heavy. I feel so empty. I extend all my love to all my LGBT+ siblings on this day.

What transpired at Pulse Nightclub is an LGBT+ hate crime. It is a racist hate crime. It is the worst mass shooting the US has ever witnessed in its history, and it is targeted at LGBT+ individuals, particularly LGBT+ PoC. Do not let this act of terrorism go unpunished. Do not let them erase this from history. Do not let them forget. Ever.

Stay safe
