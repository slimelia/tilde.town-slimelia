It's been a while since I've posted to this blog; this is mostly due to technical inconvenience, and I apologise. It feels good for my return to this blog and first post of 2017 to be delivered on the high of good news.

Just over an hour ago, news broke that Chelsea Manning's sentence is to be commuted.

Chelsea has been a hero of mine for a number of years now, and this news is incredibly uplifting to me. I'm so glad that she will soon be free, and cannot express how truly happy I am for her. To witness Chelsea be tortured for so long in prison has been heartbreaking. I look so forward to see her walking free and finally living the life she deserves. I look forward to her finally embracing the womanhood that the prisons, the judicial system and Barack Obama have so long denied her.

It is no secret that 2016 was a bad year, for reasons I need not discuss, so for such good news to break so early in 2017 feels like a good omen. I'm not superstitious, and I'm not blindly believing in something I know not to be true, but I'm silently optimistic. I'm silently optimistic that the future can be so much better, that *we* can make it better. And I am empowered.

I'm thankful for Obama's decision to commute her sentence, but not thankful *to* Obama. Unlike those who are currently praising him, I have not forgotten the man who put her in that prison. I have not forgotten the man whose conscience was absent for far, far too long on the matter. I have not forgotten the man who allowed her to be tortured for years. I will not forget. I will be empowered by my anger.

I'm sorry this post is so meandering and so dreadfully written. I don't have many words right now - instead I have many emotions. This news has been incredibly uplifting, and I pray that Chelsea will be walking free soon. I support her and I stand by her, through her remaining time in prison, and for every day she that is free. Thank you so much to everyone who fought for this - for her.

stand strong.
