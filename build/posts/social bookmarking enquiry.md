@title social bookmarking enquiry @author slimelia @date 2025-04-02T10:53hii! i already asked this exact same thing over on bluesky, but i figured i'd ask here too since the folks using rss readers _probably_ have opinions on this!question for those of you who use "read later"/social bookmarking services like pocket/instapaper/pinboard/wallabag etc. - do you actually find them useful? i've thought about setting up a self-hosted one before and then decided my probably-has-adhd brain will save articles and never read them.like.. i have articles ive been saving to read, and one of them had a bunch of CSS break so i do now have an archived version of it bookmarked. but i've had that for _ages_ and i suspect i shan't ever actually read them.do you find that using these sort of link organisers and article/page savers help you to manage and read things? answers on a postcard to <a href="mailto:slimeblog@slimelia.uk">slimeblog@slimelia.uk</a> thank youuuuuuu x
