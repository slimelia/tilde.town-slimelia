@title SORRY!!! @author slimelia @date 2024-11-21T12:44OKAY LAST FUCKING POST ON THE MATTER I PROMMY!!!there was a SECOND issue with images that i didn't notice til now: i compose blogposts via plaintext emails sent to a mailbox. plaintext emails typically have a line length imposed by the editor, after which a line break is inserted. my fucking image url had a line break in the middle of it in my last post FML. not a problem for web browsers as they handle that kind of shit very well! but a potential problem for RSS readers. (side note: browsers are so clever. did not notice my image tag typo discussed in my last post for ages because, guess what? the browser noticed it and just guessed what tag i ACTUALLY wanted and showed that instead. nice!)i added a little bit of regex to hopefully fix this now?? i email from two different clients and idk if they handle newlines differently but this definitely works for betterbird which is what i usually write posts in LMAOanyway so sorry everything should work now hopefully fingers crossed thanks byee <3<figure><img src="https://tilde.town/~slimelia/pages/SORRY!!!/purple-heart.png" alt="A purple heart." /></figure>
