ok that also didnt work BUT i've just looked at other people's RSS feeds
and they wrap their images in figure tags. so lets see if that does
anything. please enjoy the below image: a fake youtube thumbnail i made
for a tweet

<figure><img src="https://tilde.town/~slimelia/pages/testing_images.._TWO!/theranos.jpg" alt="Fake video thumbnail for a video called
&quot;Everyone Is Wrong About Elizabeth Holmes&quot; by &quot;Winkle
Bibbler&quot;. Thumbnail is black-and-white photo of Elizabeth Holmes in
profile alongside text that reads &quot;she was RIGHT.&quot; The word
&quot;right&quot; is green, bold, and italic. The rest is all black and
lowercase." title="Watch now!" /></figure>
