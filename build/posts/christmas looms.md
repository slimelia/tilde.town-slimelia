ahh, hello dear readers. been a while since i posted to my blog, and even LONGER since i posted to my gemlog, so this is a two-for-one deal where i'm manually crossposting this to both feeds. why update my blog AND gemlog when i can be a lazy cow and just post the same thing in both places?

weblog readers may be wondering if there are any crochet project updates. to which i say: shh shhhhh don't fucking ask me thattt ?? started a project in SEPTEMBER for my bestie's birthday. never finished it in time, figured i'd have to send it to her in october. didn't finish it in october. did not finish in november. it is still unfinished now. at this rate idek if it'll be finished in time to be a christmas present.. ?? IT IS A LARGE PIECE OKAY! with a lot of little fiddly extras to crochet! and also i was sick back in sept/oct and i am currently sick AGAIN fml

went to cambridge in september for a few days with my friend joe, which was fun and cute! just sort of an excuse to meet in a location that was easy to get to for both of us and nice enough to spend a few days. there's so many museums in Cambridge and we went to like, most of them? but definitely not all of them

OH i forgot it's been so long since i wrote on my gemlog that it was before i went to Scotland too. went to Scotland at the beginning of August to see the bestieeee it was fun and cute and slay even if her (then) new kitten is the devil incarnate

i got really into edibles. which is a hilarious turn of events. hello geminispace hello smallnet im a stoner now ?? loveee to get a little bit fuckt uppp on da weekends teehee

i'm struggling to think of anything meaningful to say coz im sick and also it was a long day at work so my brain is frazzled. many coding projects are still on the backburner, of course. i do want to finish writing my gemtext to html python library but i also really feel no urgency when there's so many things that already achieve that. been lurking in the tilde.town IRC from time to time, so any townies feel free to say hi if you see me!

i'm once again in the skyrim mines, which seems to happen every winter. the evenings get dark and the weather gets cold and i say "ooh why not replay todd's most mediocre masterpiece again" like a CHUMP!!!

one of the coolest things to happen in my life was sort of accidentally stumbling into a local trans community?? wplace, an r/place clone that takes place on a world map, burst into the zeigest briefly around the end of July and one important feature is that it let you list your discord username. this ended up with me adding all the other local folks who joined me in drawing massive fuckoff trans flags in our area and us forming a server. everyone eventually stopped playing wplace, but the server remains. now i just have a cool fun server of trans people in the local area who im good friends with. turns out you can in fact just sort of sit around and find friends in your area by doing nothing ??

was actually meant to meet the server owner yesterday because we somehow STILL have not met, despite me having met like basically every other regular in that server. but i called it off because i didn't want to get her sick. thank god too, i was SO out of it yesterday that my grasp on reality was like... all over the place. i was scrolling twitter unable to discern fact from fiction in my virus-addled mind. really embarrassing stuff, but i WAS sick so like. yknow. happens, i guess

i'm typing this on the evening tuesday the 2nd of december, but i'm also typing it on my phone while laying on my bed. and i WAS going to post it tonight but i am feeling particularly unwell again and kiiind of can't be arsed to turn my pc on and post this in all the places i wanna post it. so if you're reading this and the date it was posted is NOT tuesday 2nd december 2025, you know i ended up laying down and having a rest instead of uploading a blog post LMAO

well, whenever i post this, happy december and happy Me Finally Making A New Post, Ending The Post Drought. have fun darlings xoxo etc. and such as
