Welcome to my new blog. I don't know how regularly I will update it, but I spent a while writing a little lightweight blog system specifically for using on tilde.town. If you wanna check out my horrible code, you can check out [my repo for this site.](https://github.com/slimelia/tilde.town-slimelia)

This website is still very much a work in progress right now, so please pardon the mess! I've still yet to decide how I want to present my poetry. I may just end up linking to my deviantART gallery's "literature" folder if I'm super lazy, although I'd like to implement them using the same way this blog is implemented.
