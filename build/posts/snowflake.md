"hey alice didnt you say you were working on a new post where is that" I
GOT DISTRACTED AND/OR BORED!!!!!

old school runescape's raging echoes league started and i've been *way*
more into it than i expected honestly. i've always quit leagues fairly
quickly before but this time i'm way more invested - mainly because i've
been playing it with my girlfriend <3

the other thing occupying my time has been: more crochet projects! when
winter rolls around all my coding projects seem to fall by wayside and i
pick up balls of yarn and start crocheting instead. there's one crochet
project i shan't share here quite yet because it's going to be a
christmas present and there's a slim chance the recipient may see it
here. BUT look at this snowflake i made last night!!

for those curious, the pattern was designed by Katherine Eng and is
available entirely free from
[yarnspirations](https://www.yarnspirations.com/products/red-heart-snowflake-ornament)!

i do really want to finish that post i was working on AND the coding
project i started for my gemlog. BUT i suspect they're gonna be things
that occur in the new year nowwwww whoopsie
