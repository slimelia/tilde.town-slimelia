sorry if you saw the last post in your feed reader as a garbled mess lmao. the desktop email client i was using during testing does NOT encode plaintext emails as quoted-printable. the email client on my phone, however, DOES. and i had not accounted for decoding that because, frankly, i only just learned quoted-printable exists

BUT IT IS FIXED NOW. SO LET THE *NEW* NEW AGE OF POSTING COMMENCE
