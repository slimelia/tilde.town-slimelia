# tilde.town/~slimelia
Source for my [tilde town page](http://tilde.town/~slimelia/).

This repo is very similar to [slimeblogger](https://github.com/slimelia/slimeblogger). I'm just using this to sync and back up markdown documents and keep track of a few minor differences in the code that affect styling (e.g. lowercase titles instead of title case).

Nothing much to see here, if you want to use the general-use, slightly more user-friendly and documented version of my blog generator go [here](https://github.com/slimelia/slimeblogger).
